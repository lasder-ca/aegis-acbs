# Changelog

## v0.11.0-experimental

- Added the opt-in `aegis-late-guard` ACBS variant for reproduced late-upper-bound scheduler tails.
- The guard can activate only on travel-time routes after 48 completed chunks, before any upper bound, when direction switching is frequent and forward/backward efficiency estimates remain close.
- The guard uses the static lower-key direction rule and base edge budget for at most eight chunks, then returns to the normal adaptive scheduler.
- Added late-guard activation counters and chunk-level trace markers.
- Extended `replay-regret` to measure the guard beside adaptive and static ACBS, report improvement/regression, and emit a release-gate verdict.
- Added exactness and activation-scope tests for long time routes, distance routes, and short time routes.
- Added a machine-readable v0.11 release-gate script and a staged GitHub publication plan.
- Kept the default `aegis` algorithm unchanged until the Tokyo replay and 10,000-query release gates pass.

## v0.10.0-experimental

- Added `aegis replay-regret` to isolate and repeatedly remeasure meaningful tail cases retained by `validate-regret`.
- Added interleaved replay of Dijkstra, bidirectional Dijkstra, A*, static ACBS, and adaptive ACBS.
- Added classification into non-reproduced timing noise, adaptive-scheduler tails, and persistent classical-special-case tails.
- Added opt-in per-chunk ACBS traces with lower-bound gain, work, queue sizes, direction, efficiency scores, and upper-bound discovery.
- Added self-contained JSON, CSV, and HTML replay reports.
- Kept the production ACBS scheduler, potential, radix heaps, CSR graph, and exact stopping condition unchanged.

## v0.9.0-experimental

- Added `aegis validate-regret` for recursively aggregating benchmark reports across seeds and runs.
- Added observed meaningful-slowdown rate, Wilson 95% confidence interval, and exact one-sided 95% upper bound when zero events are observed.
- Added per-run JSON/CSV/HTML validation summaries and top meaningful slowdown retention.
- Added resumable `scripts/validate-tail.sh` for large multi-seed validation.
- Added configurable minimum query count and maximum acceptable meaningful-slowdown rate with CI-friendly exit status.
- Kept the v0.8 ACBS scheduler and search semantics unchanged.

## v0.8.0-experimental

- Added query-level regret diagnosis in JSON, CSV, and HTML.
- Added absolute latency penalty and configurable meaningful-regret thresholds.
- Added endpoint/query features and correlation analysis.
- Added meaningful slowdown and absolute-penalty metrics to benchmark summaries.
- Kept the v0.7 scheduler unchanged after rejecting a tail-guard prototype that regressed synthetic time-road performance.


## 0.7.0-experimental

## 0.6.0-experimental

- Replace bidirectional binary heaps with exact monotone radix heaps over non-negative reduced keys.
- Compact forward and reverse adjacency into CSR arrays after graph finalization.
- Build the node-ID lookup map lazily instead of retaining it for every routing process.
- Store bidirectional parents and touched-node indexes as 32-bit values.
- Add `aegis-projection`, an exact linear-projection feasible-potential ablation.
- Keep the default `aegis` on the stronger balanced chord potential.
- Add radix ordering, projection reduced-cost, and dual-potential correctness tests.
- Preserve the adaptive scheduler, incumbent, and coupled lower-bound termination semantics.

## 0.5.0-experimental

- Replace `container/heap` with a specialized allocation-free binary heap.
- Reuse priority-queue backing arrays through single-frontier and bidirectional workspace pools.
- Reconstruct paths with one exact-sized allocation.
- Add heap-ordering and steady-state allocation regression tests.
- Add a large-grid allocation benchmark and reproducible v0.4/v0.5 comparison script.
- Keep ACBS scheduling, potential, pruning, and exact termination semantics unchanged.

## 0.4.0-experimental

- Interleave algorithms within every repetition using a deterministic per-query shuffle to reduce cache, thermal, and fixed-order bias.
- Add mean, minimum, maximum, p50, p95, and p99 latency to CLI, JSON, CSV, and HTML.
- Add optional untimed per-query allocation measurement with `--measure-memory`.
- Record process peak RSS and Go heap/runtime memory totals.
- Split connection accounting into all connection checks, finite forward/backward overlaps, and incumbent updates.
- Add publication-scale ten-seed validation and standalone memory-profile scripts.
- Preserve `--order rotated` for comparison with v0.3 reports.

## 0.3.0-experimental

- Split queue work into pushes, pops, and stale pops.
